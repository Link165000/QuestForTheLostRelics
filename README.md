Game Design Document (GDD)
1. Game Overview
Title: Quest for the Lost Relics
Genre: Multiplayer Turn-Based RPG
Platform: PC (Python with Pygame)
2. Game Mechanics
Combat System:
Turn-based combat allowing for imaginative strategies.
Combos and elemental weaknesses will be crucial in battle.
Players can join raid parties to tackle larger enemies together.
Leveling System:
Experience points (XP) per level.
Players receive skill points to invest in skills, stats, or spells.
Skills require a minimum stat level for learning (e.g., mana for mages).
Quests:
Basic quests to start with, evolving into more complex, lore-rich quests.
Quests will be categorized by difficulty: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary.
Include faction-based quests tied to the overarching storyline.
3. World Structure
Map Design:
A massive open world (1000x1000) with detailed fog of war.
Procedural generation to create diverse terrain types (ice, fire, forest, etc.).
Main map shows details of the current chunk; mini-map shows an overview of the world.
Elemental Regions:
Each region is themed around an elemental type with unique mobs and bosses.
Corruption spreads from specific points, affecting the environment and creatures.
4. Lore
Backstory:
The Elemental Cataclysm fractured the world; now a dark force seeks to corrupt the elemental energies.
Elemental Titans and the Corrupted One:
Players will face both elemental and corrupted versions of bosses.
Quest Integration:
Uncovering the history of the Cataclysm while combating the corruption.
5. Technical Design
Architecture:
Server-client structure for multiplayer functionality.
Consider using Python sockets for networking.
Map Generation:
Use noise functions or grid-based approaches for terrain generation.
Chunk system to load and unload areas dynamically.
AI Design:
Different behaviors for elemental and corrupted creatures.
NPCs will provide quests and trading opportunities.
6. Art Style
ASCII Art:
Use ASCII art for characters, creatures, and environments for a text-based experience.
User Interface:
Simple and intuitive UI for navigation and interaction.
Next Steps for Technical Planning
Map Generation Approach:

I can suggest some methods for procedural generation, including noise functions like Perlin noise or simple grid-based generation.
Basic Combat Prototype:

I can help you create a simple combat system prototype in Python.
Networking Basics:

I can outline how to set up a basic server-client architecture using sockets in Python.
